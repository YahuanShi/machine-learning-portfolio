# 📊 Credit Scoring System – Machine Learning Project

This project builds a complete credit scoring system based on the [Give Me Some Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) dataset. It includes data cleaning, WOE binning, IV analysis, scorecard modeling (logistic regression & XGBoost), score transformation, and a Streamlit web demo for real-world simulation.

## 📌 Methods Overview

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📥 Data | Clean and prepare Kaggle dataset |
| ⚙️ Feature Eng. | WOE binning using `scorecardpy` |
| 📈 Model | Logistic Regression and XGBoost |
| 📊 Evaluation | AUC, ROC curve, score distribution plots |
| 🔢 Score Mapping | Probability → Log odds → Score (Base=600, PDO=50) |
| 🌐 Web App | Built with Streamlit: single + batch prediction |

## 🚀 Web App Usage

> Launch the demo locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 🔍 Manual Scoring  
- Input individual features  
- View probability, score, risk level

### 📂 Batch Scoring  
- Upload CSV file with feature columns  
- Get scored output + download predictions  
- See score distribution chart

## 💼 Use Cases

- Credit card application pre-screening  
- Loan approval and rejection scoring  
- Model explainability & prototyping  
- Resume project for ML/DS roles in fintech

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main packages used:

- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- `scorecardpy`, `xgboost`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `streamlit`, `joblib`

---

## 🧠 To Improve

- Add SHAP feature importance
- Support more models (LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Build REST API version (Flask/FastAPI)
- Integrate with real-time scoring interface
